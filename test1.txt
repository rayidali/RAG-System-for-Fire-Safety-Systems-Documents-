IDNet SLC for Addressable Device
Communications
Overview
The 4100ES provides standard addressable device communications
for IDNet compatible devices and accepts optional modules for
communications with MAPNET II compatible devices. Using a two wire
communications circuit, individual devices such as manual fire alarm
stations, TrueAlarm sensors, conventional IDC zones, and sprinkler
waterflow switches can be interfaced to the addressable controller to
communicate their identity and status.
Addressability allows the location and condition of the connected device
to be displayed on the operator interface LCD and on remote system
annunciators. Additionally, control circuits (fans, dampers, etc.) may be
individually controlled and monitored with addressable devices.
Addressable Operation
Each addressable device on the communication channel is continuously
interrogated for status condition such as: normal, off-normal, alarm,
supervisory, or trouble. Both Class B and Class A operation are available.
Sophisticated poll and response communication techniques ensure
supervision integrity and allow for "T-tapping" of the circuit for Class
B operation. Devices with LEDs pulse the LED to indicate receipt of a
communications poll and can be turned on steady from the panel.
IDNet Channel Capacity
The CPU bay ES-PS provides an IDNet 2 signaling line circuit (SLC) that
supports up to 250 addressable monitor and control points intermixed
on the same pair of wires. IDNet 2 and IDNet 2+2 Module SLCs are
isolated from other system reference voltages to reduce common mode

noise interaction with adjacent system wiring. Additional 250 address
IDNet 2 or IDNet 2+2 Modules are available, see Table 22.

TrueAlarm System Operation
Addressable device communications include operation of TrueAlarm
smoke and temperature sensors. Smoke sensors transmit an output
value based on their smoke chamber condition and the CPU maintains a
current value, peak value, and an average value for each sensor. Status
is determined by comparing the current sensor value to its average
value. Tracking this average value as a continuously shifting reference
point filters out environmental factors that cause shifts in sensitivity.
Programmable sensitivity of each sensor can be selected at the
control panel for different levels of smoke obscuration (shown directly
in percent) or for specific heat detection levels. To evaluate whether the
sensitivity should be revised, the peak value is stored in memory and can
be easily read and compared to the alarm threshold directly in percent.
CO sensor bases combine an electrolytic CO sensing module with a
TrueAlarm analog sensor to provide a single multiple sensing assembly
using one system address. The CO sensor can be enabled/disabled,
used in LED/Switch modes and custom control, and can be made public
for communication across a fire alarm Network. Refer to data sheet
S4098-0052 for details.
TrueAlarm heat sensors can be selected for fixed temperature
detection, with or without rate-of-rise detection. Utility temperature
sensing is also available, typically to provide freeze warnings or alert to
HVAC system problems. Readings can selected as either Fahrenheit or
Celsius.

4100ES Addressable Fire Detection and Control Basic Panel Modules and Accessories
TrueSense Early Fire Detection
Multi-sensor 4098-9754 provides photoelectric and heat sensor data
using a single 4100ES IDNet address. The panel evaluates smoke
activity, heat activity, and their combination, to provide TrueSense
early detection. For more details on this operation, refer to data sheet
S4098-0024.

Diagnostics and Default Device Type
Sensor Status
TrueAlarm operation allows the control panel to automatically indicate
when a sensor is almost dirty, dirty, and excessively dirty. The NFPA 72
requirement for a test of the sensitivity range of the sensors is fulfilled
by the ability of TrueAlarm operation to maintain the sensitivity level of
each sensor. CO Sensors track their 10 year active life status providing
indicators to assist with service planning. Indicators occur at: 1 year, 6
months, and when end of life is reached.
Modular TrueAlarm sensors
TrueAlarm sensors use the same base and different sensor types (smoke
or heat sensor) and can be easily interchanged to meet specific location
requirements. This allows intentional sensor substitution during building
construction when conditions are temporarily dusty. Instead of covering
smoke sensors (causing them to be disabled), heat sensors may be
installed without reprogramming the control panel. The control panel
will indicate an incorrect sensor type, but the heat sensor will operate at
a default sensitivity to provide heat detection for building protection at
that location.

IDNAC SLC for Addressable Notification Appliance
Communications
IDNAC Addressable notification appliance communications
include operation of TrueAlert and TrueAlert ES Visible only (V/O, strobe),
Audible only (A/O, horn), Audible/Visible (A/V, horn/strobe), and strobes
of Speaker/Visible (S/V) notification appliances. (S/V appliances require
separate speaker wiring.) IDNAC SLC addressable communications
allow each horn and strobe to be individually controlled using a single
two-wire circuit, confirms the wiring connections to the individual
notification appliance's electronic circuit, and confirms communications
between each appliance and the fire alarm control unit. Addressable
communications increases supervision integrity versus conventional
notification systems by providing supervision beyond the circuit wiring to
each individual appliance and by constantly verifying the ability of each
appliance to communicate with the control panel.
Individual Appliance Status and Settings
The fire alarm control panel monitors and records each addressable
notification appliance status, type of appliance, and its configured
appliance settings. A fault in any individual appliance automatically
reports a trouble condition to the control panel.

Panel Control Convenience
Applicable operation settings for each appliance can be programmed
without having to replace appliances or remove them from the wall or
ceiling. An appliance's VNAC notification zone can be easily changed
through programming without having to add additional circuits, conduit,
and wiring. Audible and visible appliances for non-Fire Emergency
Communications notification can be programmed to operate separately
on the same pair of wires as the fire alarm notification appliances. The
result is lower installation, retrofit, and overall life-cycle cost of ownership
compared with traditional conventional notification systems.
Installation, Retrofit, and Life-Cycle Cost Benefits
With each addressable appliance capable of being controlled separately
on the same two-wire IDNAC SLC, installation time and expense for
both retrofit and new construction can be significantly reduced. When
Class B wiring is used, wiring can be "T-tapped" allowing more savings
in distance, wire, conduit (size and utilization), and overall installation
efficiency.
Location Information, Diagnostics and Troubleshooting
Each addressable notification appliance has its own 40 character
custom label to identify the location of the appliance and to aid in
troubleshooting fault conditions. In conventional notification systems,
conventional appliances are not capable of communicating with the
control panel. Fault reporting on a conventional system is limited to
the circuit wiring and the entire area (zone) covered by appliances on
the notification appliance circuit (NAC) making it much more difficult
and costly to locate and correct the source of a problem. Using the
TrueAlert magnet test allows each appliance to individually identify
its candela setting and address and to briefly operate if desired, and
using the TrueAlert ES Appliance Self-Test feature provides detailed
performance verification per appliance.

TrueAlert ES Appliance Self-Test Operation
On-Board Test Sensors
TrueAlert ES appliances are equipped with on-board sensors to detect
strobe and/or horn output allowing efficient and unobtrusive SelfTesting. When Automatic Self-Test is initiated from the control panel,
each appliance within the selected VNAC group will briefly operate and
then report its Self-Test status to the control panel, all within several
seconds. Silent Self-Test can be selected to test only visible appliance
if desired. The control panel is in a trouble condition during testing
and in the event of an alarm, Self-Test is automatically terminated.
Additionally, Automatic Self-Test can be scheduled to occur at a
convenient time on a regular basis (Requires version 2.03.01 or higher
software).
Automatic Self-Test
Automatic Self-Test results are communicated to the control panel with
a time and date stamp and are stored in memory. Results are viewable
at the front panel display and printed reports can be generated from the
panel service port.
Individual Self-Test
Individual Self-Test is selected from the control panel when individual
appliances need to be observed to operate. Each appliance in the
selected VNAC group will turn on its LED until individually activated by
applying a magnet. After performing the individual test, the appliance
LED turns off to indicate completion. Results are recorded the same as
during the automatic test.

Figure 5: TrueAlert ES Addressable Appliance Reference
Virtual NACs Provide Control Convenience
For control convenience, IDNAC notification appliances can be grouped
into Virtual NACS (VNACs) for group control, grouping that can be made
across SLCs, not defined by their wiring connection.

ES-PS Power Supplies
ES-PS Power Supplies configured with an IDNAC card provide three, 3 A IDNAC SLCs for control and power to TrueAlert ES and TrueAlert addressable
notification appliances. Both power supplies incorporate an efficient switching design that provides a regulated output of 29 VDC, even during battery
operation. With 29 VDC minimum output at the panel, addressable notification SLCs can support wiring distances two to three times farther than
available with conventional notification, or support more appliances per SLC, or work with smaller gauge wiring, or combinations of these benefits, all
resulting in installation and maintenance savings with high assurance that appliances that operate during normal system testing will operate during
worst case alarm conditions.

Compatible peripheral devices
The 4010ES is compatible with an extensive list of remote peripheral
devices including printers and both conventional and addressable
devices including TrueAlarm analog sensors.

Addressable device control
The 4010ES provides standard addressable device communications
for IDNet compatible devices. Using a two wire communications circuit,
you can interface individual devices such as manual fire alarm stations,
TrueAlarm sensors, conventional IDC zones, and sprinkler waterflow
switches to the addressable controller to communicate their identity and
status.
Addressability facilitates the display of the location and condition of the
connected device on the operator interface LCD and on remote system
annunciators. With addressable devices, you can individually control and
monitor control circuits such as fans or dampers.
Addressable operation
Each addressable device on the communication channel is continuously
interrogated for status condition such as: normal, off-normal, alarm,
supervisory, or trouble. Both Class B and Class A pathway operation are
available. Sophisticated poll and response communication techniques
ensure supervision integrity and allow for T-tapping of the circuit for
Class B operation. Devices with LEDs pulse the LED to indicate receipt of
a communications poll. Use the control unit to turn the LED on steady.
IDNet addressable channel capacity
The Main System Supply 2 provides an electrically isolated IDNet2
signaling line circuit (SLC) that supports up to 250 addressable monitor
and control points intermixed on the same pair of wires. Additional
250 address IDNet 2+2 Modules with four short circuit isolating output
loops are available. IDNet2 and IDNet 2+2 Module SLCs are isolated
from other system reference voltages to reduce common mode noise
interaction with adjacent system wiring.

sensors including QuickConnect and QuickConnect2 sensors. For more
information, refer to data sheet S4090-0011.
Note: Some applications may require shielded wiring. Review your system with your local Simplex product supplier.

TrueAlarm system operation
Addressable device communications include operation of TrueAlarm
smoke and temperature sensors. Smoke sensors transmit an output
value based on their smoke chamber condition and the CPU maintains a
current value, peak value, and an average value for each sensor.
S4010-0006 Rev. 24 06/2022

4010ES Addressable Fire Detection and Control Basic Control Unit Modules and Accessories
Status is determined by comparing the current sensor value to its
average value. Tracking this average value as a continuously shifting
reference point filters out environmental factors that cause shifts in
sensitivity.
Programmable sensitivity
The programmable sensitivity of each sensor is selectable at the control
unit for different levels of smoke obscuration (shown directly in percent)
or for specific heat detection levels. To evaluate whether the sensitivity
should be revised, the peak value is stored in memory and can be easily
read and compared to the alarm threshold directly in percent.
CO sensor bases
CO sensor bases combine an electrolytic CO sensing module with a
TrueAlarm analog sensor to provide a single multiple sensing assembly
using one system address. You can enable or disable the CO sensor.
It can be used in LED or Switch mode and custom control. You can
make it public for communication across a fire alarm network. Refer to
data sheet TrueAlarm CO Sensor Bases for Smoke, Heat, and Photo/Heat
Sensors using IDNet Communications S4098-0052 for details.
TrueAlarm heat sensors
You can select TrueAlarm heat sensors for fixed temperature detection,
with or without rate-of-rise detection. Utility temperature sensing is also
available, typically to provide freeze warnings or alert to HVAC system
problems. Readings are selectable as either Fahrenheit or Celsius.
TrueSense early fire detection
Multi-sensor 4098-9754 provides photoelectric and heat sensor data
using a single 4010ES IDNet address. The control unit evaluates smoke
activity, heat activity, and their combination, to provide TrueSense
early detection. For more details on this operation, refer to data sheet
TrueAlarm Multi-Sensor Model A4098-9754 Providing TrueSense Early Fire
Detection S4098-0024 .

Diagnostics and default device type
Sensor status
TrueAlarm operation allows the control unit to automatically indicate
when a sensor is almost dirty, dirty, and excessively dirty. The NFPA 72
requirement for a test of the sensitivity range of the sensors is fulfilled
by the ability of TrueAlarm operation to maintain the sensitivity level of
each sensor. CO sensors track their 10 year active life status providing
indicators to assist with service planning. Indicators occur at: 1 year, 6
months, and when end of life is reached.
Modular TrueAlarm sensors
Modular TrueAlarm sensors use the same base and different sensor
types (smoke or heat sensor) and can be easily interchanged to
meet specific location requirements. This allows intentional sensor
substitution during building construction when conditions are
temporarily dusty, instead of covering smoke sensors, causing them
to be disabled. Heat sensors may be installed without reprogramming
the control unit. The control unit will indicate an incorrect sensor type,
but the heat sensor will operate at a default sensitivity to provide heat
detection for building protection at that location.

4007ES Hybrid, Fire Detection and Control Unit with Addressable and/or Conventional Initiation
Introduction

Touchscreen display with LED status indicators

4007ES Series Fire Detection and Control Units provide extensive
installation, operator, and service features with point and module
capacities suitable for a wide range of system applications. Panels can
be configured for stand-alone or networked fire control operation.
The convenient and intuitive color touchscreen provides easy access
for typical system response actions and for detailed system review or
configuration updates with password control to limit user access.
Standard conventional IDCs and addressable IDNet 2 communications
provide flexibility for both new and retrofit systems. IDC and NAC EOL
resistor values are selectable to match a wide range of existing initiating
device circuits and notification appliance circuits.

ES panel compatibility with ES Net
Simplex ES Network (ES Net) is a next generation IP-based fire network
that uses industry standard network technology and infrastructure, and
allows for simplified network upgrades, easy terminal connectivity and IP
file transfer between nodes, and advanced network diagnostics.
You can upgrade ES fire alarm control units (FACUs) to operate on an ES
network by adding an ES Net NIC to the panel.
To upgrade an existing 4120 network to ES Net, you must replace all of
the 4120 NIC cards on the network loop with ES Net NICs.
Note: ES NICs and 4120 NICs cannot be mixed on the same network
loop.

Convenient status information
With the locking door closed, the glass window allows viewing of the
display status LEDs. The user interface is a 4.3 in. (109 mm) diagonal
color touchscreen LCD with separate status LEDs, see Figure 2.
LED indicators describe the general category of activity being displayed
and the LCD provides more detail. Authorized user can unlock the door
to gain access to the control functions and scroll through the display for
additional detail.

Operator interface and software features
• Convenient and detailed operator information is easily accessible
using a logical, menu-driven touchscreen display with password access
control
• Multiple automatic and manual diagnostics for maintenance reduction
• Alarm and Trouble History Logs (up to 1000 entries for each, 2000 total
events) are available for viewing from the display or for printing to a
connected printer, or downloaded to a service computer
• Module level ground fault searching assists installation and service by
locating and isolating modules with grounded wiring
• WALKTEST silent or audible system test performs an automatic selfresetting test cycle and supports up to eight WALKTEST groups
• Install Mode allows grouping of multiple troubles for uninstalled
modules and devices into a single trouble condition (typical with future
phased expansion); with future equipment and devices grouped into
a single trouble, operators can more clearly identify events from the
commissioned and occupied areas

IDNet 2 addressable device control
The 4007ES Hybrid provides an IDNet 2 addressable initiating device
signaling line circuit (SLC) that supervises wiring connections and the
individual device communications status on the SLC. With 2-wire IDNet
2 SLCs, initiation, monitoring, and control devices such as manual
fire alarm stations, TrueAlarm sensors, control relays, and sprinkler
waterflow switches can communicate their identity and status and
receive fire alarm system control. Additional addressable interface
modules include circuit isolators, conventional IDC zone adapters, and
interface to other system circuits such as fans, dampers, and elevator
controls.

IDNet 2 addressable device operation
Each addressable device on the IDNet 2 communication channel
is continuously interrogated for status condition such as: normal,
off-normal, alarm, supervisory, or trouble. Both Class B and Class A
operation is available. Sophisticated poll and response communication
techniques ensure supervision integrity and allow for T-tapping of
the circuits for Class B operation. Devices with LEDs pulse the LED to
indicate receipt of a communications poll and can be turned on steady
from the panel. With addressable devices, the location and status of the
connected device is monitored, logged, and displayed on the operator
interface LCD with each device having its own 40-character custom label
for precise identification.

TrueAlarm addressable sensor operation
Addressable initiating device communications include operation of
TrueAlarm smoke and temperature sensors. Smoke sensors transmit
an output value based on their smoke chamber condition and the CPU
maintains a current value, peak value, and an average value for each
sensor. Status is determined by comparing the current sensor value to
its average value. Tracking this average value as a continuously shifting
reference point filters out environmental factors that cause shifts in
sensitivity.

Photo Sensor with base

Figure 4: TrueAlarm Photo/
Heat Sensor in CO base

Programmable sensitivity
Programmable sensitivity of each sensor is selectable at the control
panel for different levels of smoke obscuration, shown directly in
percent, or for specific heat detection levels. To evaluate whether the
sensitivity should be revised, the peak value is stored in memory and can
be easily read or downloaded as a report and compared to the alarm
threshold directly in percent.
CO sensor bases
CO sensor bases combine an electrolytic CO sensing module with a
TrueAlarm analog sensor to provide a single multiple sensing assembly
using one system address. You can enable and disable the CO sensor,
and you can use it in LED/Switch modes and custom control. Refer to
data sheet S4098-0052 for more details.

TrueAlarm heat sensors
You can select TrueAlarm heat sensors for fixed temperature detection,
with or without rate-of-rise detection. Utility temperature sensing is also
available, typically to provide freeze warnings or alert to HVAC system
problems. Readings are selectable as either Fahrenheit or Celsius.
TrueSense early fire detection
Multi-sensor 4098-9754 provides photoelectric and heat sensor data
using a single IDNet address. The panel evaluates smoke activity, heat
activity, and their combination, to provide TrueSense early detection. For
more details on this operation, refer to data sheet S4098-0024.

Diagnostics and default device type
Sensor status
TrueAlarm operation allows the FACU to automatically indicate when
a sensor is almost dirty, dirty, and excessively dirty. The NFPA 72
requirement for a test of the sensitivity range of the sensors is fulfilled
by the ability of TrueAlarm operation to maintain the sensitivity level of
each sensor. CO sensors track their 10 year active life status providing
indicators to assist with service planning. Indicators occur at: 1 year, 6
months, and end of life.
Modular TrueAlarm sensors
TrueAlarm sensors use the same base and different sensor types (smoke
or heat sensor) and can be easily interchanged to meet specific location
requirements. This allows intentional sensor substitution during building
construction when conditions are temporarily dusty. Instead of covering
smoke sensors causing them to disable, heat sensors may be installed
without reprogramming the FACU. The FACU will indicate an incorrect
sensor type, but the heat sensor will operate at a default sensitivity to
provide heat detection for building protection at that location.

IDNet 2 addressable channel capacity
The 4007ES Hybrid provides an isolated output IDNet 2 SLC that
supports up to 250 addressable monitor and control points intermixed
on the same pair of wires. 250 total requires two 4007-9803 IDNet 2
loop expansion modules.
